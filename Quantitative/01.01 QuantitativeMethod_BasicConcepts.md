## Time Value Of Money

### Interest Rate

PV -> FV

Interest Rate:

Interpretations: 

1. Required Rate of Return => Present -> Future
2. Discount Rate                   => Future -> Present
3. Opportunity Cost             => Do Others

Components (利率是怎么来的):

Nominal Interest Rate = Nominal Risk-Free Interest Rate + Risk Premium

Nominal Risk-Free Interest Rate = Real Risk-Free Interest Rate + Inflation Rate(Π)

Risk Premium includes but not limits to:

* Default Risk Premium => 违约风险
* Liquidity Risk Premium => 流动性：想买买不到，想卖卖不出
* Maturity Risk Premium => 时间越长越不好说

### Effective Annual Rate

需要会计算不同计息Frequency下相同Stated(Quoted) Annual Interest Rate (r<sub>s</sub>)对应的EAR

Continuous Compounded : EAR = e<sup>r<sub>s</sub></sup> - 1

Periodic Interest rate: (1+r<sub>s</sub>/n)<sup>n</sup>-1 => n is times in a year

### Future Value and Present Value & Annuity

Annuity: A set of constant sequential cash flows

* Ordinary annuity: all constant cash flows occurring at the end of each period
* Annuity due: all constant cash flows occurring at the beginning of each period
* Perpetuity: a set of constant never-ending sequential cash flows occurring at the end of each period

Present value of perpetuity:

​	PV = A/r<sub>s</sub>

​	=> A = the periodic payment to be received forever
