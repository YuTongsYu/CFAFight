### Basic Concepts of Probability

#### Basic Concepts

1. Relationship among Events

* Mutually exclusive events
  * The events competing directly with each other that they would not happen at same time
* Exhaustive events
  * Events cover all possible outcomes (不必互斥)
* Independent events
  * Occurrence of events does not influence each other
* Dependent events
  * Occurrence of event A does influence the occurrence of event B

2. Types of probability

* Empirical probability
  * Estimate based on historical data (过去推测未来)
* Priori probability
  * Estimate based on logical analysis (过去推测过去)
* Subjective Probability (我认为)

3. Unconditional & Conditional Probability

* Unconditional Probability (Marginal Probability) 因为写在了表格的边边
* Conditional Probability
  * For independent events: P(A|B) = P(A)
  * P(A)先验
  * P(A|B)后验

4. Odds

* Odds for the event 
  * P(E)/[1-P(E)], given a probability P(E)
* Odds against the event
  * [1-P(E)]/P(E)

#### Algorithms of Probability

1. Joint Probability

$$
A、B\ are \ mutually\ exclusive\ events <=>\ P(AB)=0\ <=>\ 
\left\{
\begin{matrix}
 P(A|B) = 0 \\
 P(B|A) = 0 \\
 (必须同时满足)
\end{matrix}
\right.
$$

* P(AB) = P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A)
* If A B are independent, P(AB) = P(A)P(B)
* If A B are mutually exclusive, P(AB) = 0
