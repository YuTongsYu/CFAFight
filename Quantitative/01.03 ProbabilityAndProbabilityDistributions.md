### Basic Concepts of Probability

#### Basic Concepts

1. Relationship among Events

* Mutually exclusive events
  * The events competing directly with each other that they would not happen at same time
* Exhaustive events
  * Events cover all possible outcomes (不必互斥)
* Independent events
  * Occurrence of events does not influence each other
* Dependent events
  * Occurrence of event A does influence the occurrence of event B

2. Types of probability

* Empirical probability
  * Estimate based on historical data (过去推测未来)
* Priori probability
  * Estimate based on logical analysis (过去推测过去)
* Subjective Probability (我认为)

3. Unconditional & Conditional Probability

* Unconditional Probability (Marginal Probability) 因为写在了表格的边边
* Conditional Probability
  * For independent events: P(A|B) = P(A)
  * P(A)先验
  * P(A|B)后验

4. Odds

* Odds for the event 
  * P(E)/[1-P(E)], given a probability P(E)
* Odds against the event
  * [1-P(E)]/P(E)

### Algorithms of Probability

1. Joint Probability

$$
A、B\ are \ mutually\ exclusive\ events <=>\ P(AB)=0\ <=>\ 
\left\{
\begin{matrix}
 P(A|B) = 0 \\
 P(B|A) = 0 \\
 (必须同时满足)
\end{matrix}
\right.
$$

* P(AB) = P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A)
* If A B are independent, P(AB) = P(A)P(B)
* If A B are mutually exclusive, P(AB) = 0

2. Addition Rule

P(A+B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(AB)

### Total Probability Rules & Bayes' Formula

##### Total Probability Rules

* Explains unconditional probability of the event in terms of probabilities conditional on the scenarios
* P(A) = P(A|S<sub>1</sub>)P(S<sub>1</sub>)+P(A|S<sub>2</sub>)P(S<sub>2</sub>)+...+P(A|S<sub>n</sub>)P(S<sub>n</sub>) where S<sub>i</sub> are mutually exclusive and exhaustive

##### Bayes' Formula

$P(B|A) = \frac {P(A|B)P(B)} {P(A)}$

### Application of Probability in Investment

* Expected Value (E(X))
  * Expected value is the probability weighted average of the possible outcomes of the random variable
  * E(X) = $\sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i)x_i$
* Variance
  * $\sigma^2(X)=\sum_{i=1}^nP(X_i)[X_i-E(X)]^2$

* Covariance

  * A measure of how two pair variables move together(必须是成对出现)
  * Cov measures the linear relationship between two variables (注意是线性关系，=0不代表没关系，可能有非线性关系)
  * Cov(X,Y) = E[(X - E(X))(Y - E(Y))] = E(XY)-E(X)E(Y)
  * Positive Covariance means two variables tends to increase or decrease at the same time
  * Negative Covariance means one variable tends to increase when the other decreases
  * Ranges from -inf to inf

* Correlation

  * A Standardized measure of linear relationship between two variables
  * Range from -1 to 1
  * $\rho$越大集中趋势越明显，越聚集，跟斜率无关

  $$
  \rho_{i,j}=\frac {Cov(R_i,R_j)} {\rho_i\rho_j}\\
  r_{i,j}=\frac {Cov(R_i,R_j)} {s_is_j}
  $$

### Permutaion and Combination

(一般不直接出题)

* Labeling: The number of ways that n objects can be labeled with k different labels, with n<sub>i</sub> of the i th type and $\sum_{i=1}^n n_i = n$. Then

  number of ways = $\frac {n!} {n_1!n_2!...n_k!}$

### Basic Concepts of Probability Distribution

* A random variable is a variable whose value depends on the outcome of a probabilistic experiment
  * FDiscrete random variable: takes on countable number of possible values
  * Continuous random variable: uncountable number of possible values
* Probability Distribution specifies the probabilites of possible outcomes for a random variable
  * Discrete distribution: the distribution of discrete random variable
  * Continuous distribution: the distribution of continuous random variable
* Probability Function specifies the probability that the **discrete random variable** takes on a specific value P(X = x)
* Probability Density Function (PDF) specifies the probability that the continuous random variable takes on a value within a range
  * $P(x_1<X<x_2)=\int_{x_1}^{x_2}f(x)dx$
  * The probability of taking on a specific value is 0 => P(X=x<sub>1</sub>) = 0
* Cumulative Probability Function (CDF) F(x)
  * $F(x_i) = P(X\leq x_i$)
  * $P(x_1 < X \leq x_2) = F(x_2)-F(x_1)$
* Univariate & Multivariate Distribution (基本不考 了解)
  * Univariate Distribution: Describes a single random variable
  * Multivariate Distribution: Describes the probabilities for a group of related random variable

### Discrete Distributions

(二项分布基本是每年必考一道题)

* Discrete Uniform Distribution

  * Has finite number of possible outcomes which are equally likely

* Bionominal Distribution

  * Bernoulli random variable: random variable with only 2 outcomes, one represents success, the other represents failure

  * Bionomial random variable: The number of successes in n Bernoulli trials, assuming that:

    1. The trails are all independent
    2. P(success) is constant for all trials

    X ~ B(n, p).   E(X) = np    Var(X) = np(1-p)

  * $P(x)=C_n^xp^x(1-p)^{n-x}$

* Negative Binomial Distribution

  * 为了成功m次，每次成功的概率是p，求至少需要进行r次伯努利实验的概率

    => 等价于前r-1次成功m-1次的概率乘以p (第r次成功了)

    => $P(X=r) = p * C_{r-1}^{m-1}p^{m-1}(1-p)^{(r-1)-(m-1)}$

    => $P(X=r) = C_{r-1}^{m-1}p^m(1-p)^{r-m}$

### Continuous Distributions

#### Normal Distribution

* $X~N(\mu,\sigma^2)$
* Completely described by mean and variance
* Skewness = 0
* Kurtosis = 3
* Linear combinations of normally distributed variables is also normally distributed
* Probability decrease further from the mean, but the tails go on forever

Confidence Intervals that should be remembered

* 68% => $\mu$ +/- $\sigma$
* 90% => $\mu$ +/- 1.65$\sigma$
* 95% => $\mu$ +/- 1.96$\sigma$
* 99% => $\mu$ +/- 2.58$\sigma$

Standardization:

* $z=\frac {X-\mu} \sigma$

* The z value represents the number of standard deviations from the mean

* Z Table: $\Phi(x) = P(X\leq x)$

  ​			  $\Phi(-x) = 1-\Phi(x)$

#### Lognormal Distribution

* If X is normally distributed, $e^x$ is lognormal distributed

* If lnX is normally distributed, X is lognormal distributed

* Lognormal random variable is bounded from below by zero(以0为下限)

* It is positively skewed

* It is used to model asset prices, 推导如下（不需要掌握）

  Assume price of stocks ~ lognormal distribution, then

  ln(price) ~ N 							=>

  ln(price<sub>1</sub>) - ln(price<sub>0</sub>) ~ N 		 =>

  ln(1 + $\frac {price_1-price_0} {price_0}$) ~ N, And we know that $\lim_{x\to \infty} ln(1+x) = x$, As the stock prices are continous varied and the difference between time is small, 			Therefore: $\frac {price_1-price_0} {price_0}$ ~ N

  which means that the return is normally distributed

* $1 \leq Kurtosis \leq n$ where n is the population size (不需要掌握)

#### Continuous Uniform Distribution

* Probability of continuous uniform random variable which distributed evenly over an interval

* PDF:
  $$
  f(x) = \left\{
  \begin{matrix}
  \frac 1 {b-a} \ for\ a < x < b\\
  0\ otherwise\\
  \end{matrix}
  \right.
  $$

* Probability for a interval:
  $$
  P(a\leq x\leq b) = \int_a^bf(x)dx
  $$

* Cumulative Probability Distribution:
  $$
  F(x) =\left\{
  \begin{matrix}
  0\ for\ x\leq a \\
  \frac {x-a} {b-a}\ for\ a<x<b \\
  1\ for\ x\geq b \\
  \end{matrix}
  \right.
  $$
  

#### T-Distribution

* Defined by single parameter: degrees of freedom (df)
  * df = n - 1 where n is the sample size
* Skewness = 0
* Lower top and fatter tail than normal distribution
* As df increases, T-distribution is approaching to standard normal distribution
* Given a degree of confidence, T-Distribution has a wider confidence interval than z-distribution

#### Shortfall Risk(不考)

Shortfall Risk is the risk that portfolio value or return will fall below the minimum acceptable level (R<sub>L</sub>, shortfall level, threshold level) over some time horizon

The lower, the better (说的是risk不是acceptable level 越低越好)

#### Safety First Ratio(不考)

* The distance from the mean return to the shortfall level in units of standard deviation
* The higher, the better

$$
SFRatio = \frac {E(R_p)-R_L} {\sigma_p}\ ,\ R_L\ is\ shortfall\ level
$$

#### Mente Carlo Simulation(不考)

Use randomly generated values for risk factors, based on their assumed distributions, to produce a distribution of possible outcome

用随机产生的风险因子，基于他们的假设分布，产生可能的结果的分布

Limitation:

* Fairly Complex
* Do not directly provide precise insights
* Provide answer no better than the assumption used

#### Historical Simulation(不考)

Use randomly selected past data in risk factors to produce a distribution of possible outcome

Limitation:

* Grounded in actual data and reflect only the risks represented in the sample historical data
* Does not lend itself to "what if" analyses
