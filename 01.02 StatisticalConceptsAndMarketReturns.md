### Basic Concepts

Measurement Scales

* Nominal Scale     - just a name

* Ordinal Scale       - can sort 
* Interval Scale       - can sort - can use add/subtraction 
  * 可以求加减平均值等，但不存在基准0值，即当变量值为0时不是表示没有，如温度变量，当温度为0时，并不是表示没有温度
* Ratio Scale           - has true zero point as origin - can sort, add, subtract, multiply, divide

### Measures of Central Tendency

#### Means

* Arithmetic Mean

  * Easy to work with mathematically
  * Uses all information about the size and magnitude of the observations (no waste)
  * But sensitive to extreme values

  **Used to calculate single period return**

* Weighted Mean
  $$
  \bar X_w\ =\ \sum_{i=1}^n w_iX_i\ 
  \\ where\ w_1+w_2+......+w_n\ =\ 1
  $$
  

  **Used to calculate the portfolio return or the expected value based on probabilities**

* Geometric Mean
  $$
  G = \sqrt[n]{X_1X_2X_3...X_n}
  $$
  **Focus on the profitability of an investment over a multi-period horizon**
  $$
  Periodic\ Return_{compound}\ =\ \sqrt[n]{(1+R_1)(1+R_2)......(1+R_n)}\ - \ 1
  $$
  

* Harmonic Mean
  $$
  \bar X_{Harmonic}\ =\ \frac {N}{\sum_{i=1}^N\frac 1 {X_i}}\\
  Where\ N\ =\ number\ of\ purchases(equal\ $\ amounts)\\
  X_i\ =\ share\ price\ for\ each\ purchase
  $$
  **Used to find the average cost per share of stock purchased over time in constant dollar amount (每种股价不同的股票买1块钱的平均成本)**

* When all data are the same then these means are the same, otherwise:

  **Harmonic Mean < Geometric Mean < Arithmetic Mean**

  The difference between these means increase <=> the variability of observations increase

#### Median

Odd -> 第(n+1)/2个

Even ->第(n/2)个和第(n/2+1)个的平均数

* Not affected by extreme values
* But only one or two numbers considered, rest ignored

#### Mode

Most Frequently occurring value of the distribution

Can have more than one mode or even no mode

在大样本里才有意义，作为一个补充指标

#### Quantile

sort first

* Quartiles: divided into quarters
* Quintiles: divided into the fifths
* Deciles: divided into the tenths
* Percentiles: divided into the hundredths

Formula for Location of data in ascending order:
$$
L_y\ =\ (n+1)\frac y {Q}
$$

### Measures of Dispersion: Range, MAD, Variance & Standard Deviation

Dispersion describes the variability around the central tendency => risk

#### Range

Range = Maximum Value - Minimum Value

* Easy for computation
* But only two numbers are considered
* But the distribution of the data set is not told

#### MAD(mean absolute deviation)
